# Slot-Machine
This is a jquery project that I made in class for which utilizes a few skills that I picked up and are polishing up.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Arrays, and If Else.

My HTML contains sections, img tags, and elements to display text. I gave it styling in the CSS to make it stand out a little more. In my javascript I use arrays to cycle thru the pictures with a random generator to mix up the images and keep them cycling around and have a betting system in place. I have a jackpot method test your luck and get some serious loot.

## Optimizations
I feel confident with the product that I put out if I could improve it more I would change and fix the handle to not display a black backround on the click function.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about arrays with this project and this was a chance for me to get a better grasp on random number generation. and creating a matching game that rewards winning and displays failure.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
